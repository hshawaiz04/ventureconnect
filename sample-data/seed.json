        "content": "Hi Priya, great question. With a small budget, focus is key. I'd recommend starting with:\n\n1.  **Instagram & Facebook:** Build a community around your brand. Use high-quality visuals of your products. Run small, targeted ad campaigns (you can start with as little as ₹500/day).\n2.  **Micro-influencers:** Partner with smaller influencers in the fashion/lifestyle niche who have high engagement. They are often more affordable and authentic.\n3.  **Content Marketing:** Start a blog or create social media content around leather care, styling tips, etc. This helps with long-term SEO and builds trust.\n\nDon't spread yourself too thin. Pick one or two channels, do them well, and then expand as you grow. Good luck!",
